![Face Recognition]([images/face_recognition_banner.jpg](https://www.swiftlane.com/static/da27c6bbc87ffee7ad56f5d1d795ac79/a8acc/3.jpg))

## 📌 Introduction
The **Real-time Face Recognition System** is a Python-based application that detects and recognizes faces using **OpenCV** and **Local Binary Patterns Histogram (LBPH)**. The system allows capturing and storing facial data, training a recognition model, and identifying individuals in real-time. This project is ideal for **security, attendance tracking, and identity verification**.

## ✨ Features
-✅ **Real-time Face Detection** using Haar cascades.
-✅ **Face Recognition** with LBPH for fast and efficient identification.
-✅ **Multi-Angle Training** to improve recognition accuracy.
-✅ **Automatic Model Updating** when new faces are added.
-✅ **Threaded Execution** for optimized performance.
-✅ **Graphical Interface (Planned Enhancement)**.

## 📋 System Requirements
### Hardware
- A computer with a webcam (built-in or external)
- Minimum **4GB RAM** for smooth execution
- Recommended: **Intel i5 or higher**

### Software
- **Python 3.x**
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)**
- **NumPy (`numpy`)**
- **Pickle (`pickle`)**
- **Threading (`concurrent.futures`)**

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
```
2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**:
```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```
3️⃣ **Run the Application**:
```sh
python trial.py
```

## 🛠 Execution Flow
1. **Start the system** (Webcam initializes).
2. **Detect faces** in real-time.
3. **Recognize known faces** and display names.
4. **Train new faces** if unrecognized.
5. **Save new faces** and update the model.

## 📊 Challenges & Solutions
| Challenge            | Solution |
|---------------------|----------|
| Poor lighting       | Adaptive Histogram Equalization |
| Partial occlusions  | Multi-angle training |
| Slow processing     | Multi-threading for optimization |
| Limited dataset     | Expand dataset with diverse images |

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Integration (CNNs)** for enhanced accuracy.
- **Multi-camera Support** for large-scale security.
- **Cloud-based Face Recognition**.
- **GUI Interface** for better user experience.
